## Title
# E-commerce Back End

## Description
To elaborate further, the challenge involves building the server-side functionality of an online store using the popular Node.js framework, Express.js. This back-end code will be responsible for handling incoming requests from the front-end, interacting with the MySQL database through Sequelize, and returning appropriate responses to the client. Overall, creating a robust and reliable back-end system is essential to the success of any e-commerce website, as it is responsible for handling many of the core functions that make online shopping possible.

## Usage
Navigate to Insomnia Core to GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE, requests. The URL will be through http://localhost:3001/api/ *products
